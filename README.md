## Hi there 👋

I'm Harshit Rao, a Information Technology graduate with a strong foundation in algorithms, software engineering, and machine learning.  

I enjoy building reliable software systems, working close to the system level, and applying ML/NLP in real-world applications.   

I’m currently focused on deepening my expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning, while also exploring creative and experimental projects in Unity whenever I get the chance.
